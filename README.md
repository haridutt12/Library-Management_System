# Library-Management_System (in Dev mode)
The purpose of this project is to provide a friendly environment to maintain the details of books and library members.

The main purpose of this project is to maintain easy circulation system using computers and to provide different reports.

It is a package to be used by Libraries to improve the efficiency of Librarians, Library employees and Users.

The system provides books catalogue and information to members and helps them decide on the books to borrow from the library.

The Librarian can keep the books catalogue updated all the time so that the members (students and the professors) get the updated information all the time.
